*Yes, we have dynamic lighting.*

[Русская версия](README_RU.md)

Another arena shooter in Rust. Because the world definitely needed one more.
Fast, buggy, and purely fueled by nostalgia and caffeine.

### How to Install
I spent more time on these installation scripts than on the physics engine. They are beautiful.

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-kuz/sas/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-kuz/sas/main/scripts/install.bat -o install.bat && install.bat
```

### Disclaimer
**You need a legal copy of Quake 3 Arena** to play.
This project provides the code; id Software provided the fun part 25 years ago.

# SAS III
## Still Alive Somehow??

Yes, it's another arena shooter. No, I don't know why. Yes, it's written in Rust. No, it didn't make it faster.

[Русская версия](README.ru.md)

### What is this?

A Quake 3-inspired shooter that has survived three iterations and still doesn't understand why it exists. It has bots, gibs physics, and a railgun. What else do you need for happiness in 2025?

### Screenshots

![Gibs Physics](assets/screenshoots/gibs-physics.jpeg)
*Gibs physics works. That's what matters.*

![Rail Gun](assets/screenshoots/rail.jpeg)
*There's a railgun. That means it's a real arena shooter.*

*Plasma glows. Pretty, right?*

### Running

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Or use one of the 47 build scripts in the project root. They all work. Probably.

### Features

- ✅ Bots with navigation graphs
- ✅ Network play (works 30% of the time)
- ✅ JSON maps (because XML is so last century)
- ✅ Dedicated server (for those who want to suffer alone)
- ✅ WASM build (runs in browser, lags everywhere)
- ✅ iOS support (why? don't ask)
- ✅ Map editor (because notepad is too mainstream)

### System Requirements

- Rust (latest you can find)
- Patience
- Nostalgia for 1999
- Readiness for nothing to work on the first try

### License

Do whatever you want, I'm not your mom.

## Still Alive Somehow

Another arena shooter in Rust. Because the world definitely needed one more.
Fast, buggy, and purely fueled by nostalgia and caffeine.

### How to Install
I spent more time on these installation scripts than on the physics engine. They are beautiful.

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-kuz/sas/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (cmd):**
```cmd
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-kuz/sas/main/scripts/install.bat -o install.bat & install.bat
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-kuz/sas/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Disclaimer
**You need a legal copy of Quake 3 Arena** to play.
This project provides the code; id Software provided the fun part 25 years ago.
